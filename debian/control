Description: Small SNMP daemon
 The Mini SNMP daemon is a minimal implementation of an SNMP daemon.  It
 is primarily targeted at embedded systems with limited disk and memory
 resources.  All configuration can be done using command line arguments,
 or via the optional /etc/mini-snmpd.conf file.  It supports basic CPU,
 memory, disk, and network interface statistics.
 .
 mini-snmpd is not as flexibible as, and does not support the same
 features as, the de-facto standard net-snmp, but this also means it
 does not have the same footprint and overhead.
 .
 Supported features:
 .
   * SNMP version 1 and 2c
   * Community string authentication when using 2c or explicitely configured
   * Read-only access (writing is not supported)
   * Basic system info like CPU load, memory, disk and network interfaces
   * Does not need a configuration file, but one is supported
   * Supports UDP and TCP (thus supports SSH tunneling of SNMP connections)
